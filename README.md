# multipurpose-display
 
This is a quick and dirty wrapper to combine the functionality of the [activity board](https://github.com/davidsmakerworks/activity-board)
project and the [media display](https://github.com/davidsmakerworks/media-display) project.

It starts in media display mode, and then switches to the activity board when the **START** button is pressed on the joystick or **ESC** is pressed on the keyboard. This will not be processed 
until the image changes or the current video is finished so there will be a short delay before the activity board starts.

In the activity board, hold **BACK** on the joystick for 2 seconds or hold **LEFT-SHIFT**+**LEFT-CTRL**+**Q** on the keyboard to return to the media display mode.
